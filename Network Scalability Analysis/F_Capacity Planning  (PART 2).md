# **SYSADM1 â€“ Capacity Management & Planning**
# **Part 2. Network Scalability Analysis**
Recall the e-commerce website scenario we discussed earlier. Given the expected surge in traffic, analyze the provided network topology diagram. Identify potential bottlenecks and areas where scalability might be a concern. Propose specific strategies to improve the network's scalability and performance to ensure a seamless user experience during the peak traffic period. Consider factors such as increased user demand, new applications, and security threats.

|<p></p><p>**Bottlenecks and Scalability Concerns**</p><p>- Key concerns include the central server's capacity to handle high traffic, with potential struggles arising from insufficient processing power, memory, or storage. Network switches and routers could become chokepoints due to limited bandwidth or outdated protocols, while poorly configured load balancers may cause uneven traffic distribution. Database scalability is another issue, as growing demand can lead to latency or downtime without horizontal or vertical scaling. Additionally, increased traffic heightens security risks, such as DDoS attacks or unauthorized access, necessitating robust protective measures.</p><p></p><p></p><p>**Proposed Scalability Strategies**</p><p>- To address these bottlenecks, several strategies can be implemented. First, upgrading the server hardware, such as adding more CPU cores, increasing memory, or employing faster solid-state drives (SSDs), can directly enhance performance. Implementing a distributed architecture with multiple servers can also mitigate risks of overload by enabling horizontal scaling.</p><p>- For network switches and routers, upgrading to high-bandwidth devices or incorporating Software-Defined Networking can improve traffic management and flexibility. Load balancers should be enhanced with auto-scaling features and advanced algorithms to ensure an even distribution of traffic.</p><p></p><p></p><p>**Evaluation of Proposed Solutions**</p><p>- While these strategies promise significant benefits, they also come with trade-offs. Hardware upgrades, while effective, can be costly and require downtime for implementation. Cloud migration provides flexibility but involves ongoing costs and potential security risks. Advanced load balancers and SDN setups may demand specialized expertise and additional configuration time.</p><p></p><p></p><p>**Proposed Design and Justification**</p><p>- A comprehensive design to accommodate the expected traffic surge should include a combination of horizontal scaling for servers, a robust load-balancing mechanism, and enhanced security measures like firewalls and intrusion detection systems. It should also integrate a hybrid cloud model to balance on-premises and cloud-based resources for optimal cost and scalability.</p><p>- Considering cost, complexity, and impact, the proposed solutions are justifiable for ensuring long-term performance and reliability. The trade-offs, while notable, are outweighed by the benefits of a seamless and secure user experience, particularly during peak periods.</p><p></p><p></p>|
